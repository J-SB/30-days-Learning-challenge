# Name and Main in Python
The __name__ variable (two underscores before and after) is a special Python variable. It gets its value depending on how we execute the containing script.

Sometimes you write a script with functions that might be useful in other scripts as well. In Python, you can import that script as a module in another script.

Thanks to this special variable, you can decide whether you want to run the script. Or that you want to import the functions defined in the script.
